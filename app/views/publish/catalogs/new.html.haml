    Here you can group your products separately according to your choice. Group
    all your works together under one catalog, or separate them as you like.
  %p
    Select the "Private" checkbox to add the item to your PRIVATE catalog,
    which will ensure that only the people who have your chosen password will
    be able to see your products within that catalog. This feature is great for
    wedding videos, special event videos, or any other video or music you do not
    want the general public to see. You can send out your password by email
    invitation also.
  %p
    Create a password which will be automatically added to your invitation email.
    Go to the "Products" tab to send your invitation email.
