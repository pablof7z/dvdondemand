    %strong What is an ISO image file?
  %p
    An ISO-9660 image file is an exact representation of a CD or DVD disk,      |
    including the content and the logical format. The most common use of an     |
    image file is to use it with a software tool and a blank disk to create an  |
    identical copy of the original disk including all file and folder names and |
    volume label information. Files with the ISO image format may also be       |
    opened and their contents copied to a local folder, much like ZIP files.    |
    ISO image files may also be virtually mounted and accessed as if they were  |
    a CD-ROM device, even when you do not have a CD or DVD drive. These three   |
    methods of using ISO images are described below.
    %ul
      %li Create CD or DVD disk with an ISO image file
      %li Copy or mount ISO image files (...if you don't have a CD/DVD burner).
      %li Find other tools that do the same.

    %p
      %strong Copy or Mount ISO files
    %p
      When you do not have the necessary disk-write capabilities with your CD or |
      DVD drive, or no drive at all, then the contents of image files may be     |
      accessed directly using third-party tools. Some tools extract the files    |
      from an image file to a temporary folder on your hard drive, and then run  |
      setup from your hard drive. And at least one tool in the following list    |
      makes it easy to simply double-click an ISO file and run the set up program |
      that installs the software. You might not end up with a backup disk using  |
      these tools, but then you won't need one if you can backup one of these    |
      programs and your ISO files! The following tools offer such image file     |
      support.

            not other tools you might find listed on this web site.
          %li
            After installing, literally double-click an ISO file to run setup    |
            and install the software packed inside that file!

          IsoBuster

          %li
            IsoBuster is able to open ISO files and treat them as regular CD     |
            or DVD discs, and a lot more if that's what you're looking for.
          %li
            May need to set up File Associations after installation if you want  |
            to open an ISO file with a double-click.
