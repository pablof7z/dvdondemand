I have recently published a new product <%= @product.title %> in my catalog <%= @product.catalogs.first.title %>,
and thought you might be interested in seeing it.

You can see it in <%= "#{URL}#{retail_catalog_product_path(@product.catalogs.first, @product)}" %>.

<% if @product.catalogs.first.private %>  
  This catalog is private, so you will need to enter the password '<%= @product.catalogs.first.password %>' to access it.
<% end %>

<%= @product.publisher.full_name %>
