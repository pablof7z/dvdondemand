    Remember, you receive a commission for every disc sold by one of your publishers.

    As an affiliate you have a couple of options for obtaining sign-ups under your account. One of your options is to use our “Introductions” tab that will send a customized email inviting your friends and associates to become publishers on our site.
  %p
    Another option is to add your very own customized link to your web site. This link will credit your affiliate account anytime someone signs up as a publisher through it. This method allows you to set the link, and never lift a finger again to generate revenue.
