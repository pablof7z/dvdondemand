## About Devise auth. gem usage

Devise's RDdoc documentation is great, be sure to read it thoroughly!

Another great resource is it's GitHub Wiki, be sure to check it for hands-on tips: http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/

Wiki-mentioned used so far, in application_controller.rb:

* custom layout according to Devise resource thanks to http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Create-custom-layouts
* custom sign out redirection according to Devise resource thanks to http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Change-the-redirect-path-after-destroying-a-session-%28signing-out%29

And in routes.rb ("map.publisher_root" rule), path used for publish/publishers_controller.rb#home:

* default route to be used after signing in thanks to http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:j5n40xIYS2wJ:github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Redirect-to-a-specific-page-on-successful-sign-in+http://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/howto-redirect-to-a-specific-page-on-successful-sign-in&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&client=ubuntu



## About RailRoad gem usage

We're using the "tobias-railroad" fork of the RailRoad gem because it includes explicit patches to make it work with at least Rails 2.3.5.

Just run this command from the app. home directory:

    railroad -M --exclude=app/models/items_products.rb,app/models/catalogs_products.rb --hide-magic | neato -Tpng > doc/models.png

Notable options used:

* Include just the models in the graphic
* Exclude the associations' tables to avoid unnecesary clutter
* Hide Rails' "magic" columns/fields/attributes
