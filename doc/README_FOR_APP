## About RailRoad gem usage

We're using the "tobias-railroad" fork of the RailRoad gem because it includes explicit patches to make it work with at least Rails 2.3.5.

Just run this command from the app. home directory:

    railroad -M --exclude=app/models/items_products.rb,app/models/catalogs_products.rb --hide-magic | neato -Tpng > doc/models.png

Notable options used:

* Include just the models in the graphic
* Exclude the associations' tables to avoid unnecesary clutter
* Hide Rails' "magic" columns/fields/attributes
